# Bounny support

An AI personal assistant who listens to what you said and makes memos to remind you. Ideal to anyone who manages anything.

## Overview

When I was managing a software startup, I gave so many instructions to various teams on different subjects every day that I often forgot what I had said by the next day. I asked for an assistant to write down everything I said, but of course, I was turned down. Now, thanks to OpenAI, I can have a loyal assistant at minimal cost. Bounny will listen to everything you say and create memos to remind you.

There are two types of summaries available. The default option is a checklist aimed at business people, while the other is a regular summary. Both types of summaries are editable and can be translated into other languages.

The app is specifically designed to recognize the speech of an individual, rather than recording or transcribing conference discussions. It is recommended to use the app with earphones for the best experience.
